The machine-level representation of built-in types in C++ varies depending on the specific computer architecture. However, there are some general principles that apply to most architectures.

Integer types are typically represented using two's complement arithmetic. This means that the most significant bit of the integer is used to represent the sign of the number, with a 1 representing a negative number and a 0 representing a positive number. The remaining bits represent the magnitude of the number.

Floating-point types are typically represented using the IEEE 754 standard. This standard defines a variety of floating-point formats, including single-precision, double-precision, and extended-precision formats. Single-precision floating-point numbers are typically represented using 32 bits, while double-precision floating-point numbers are typically represented using 64 bits.

Character types are typically represented using the ASCII character encoding. ASCII is a 7-bit encoding that maps characters to integers. For example, the character 'A' is mapped to the integer 65.

Boolean types are typically represented using a single bit. A value of 1 represents true, while a value of 0 represents false.

The following table shows the typical machine-level representation of built-in types in C++ on a 64-bit x86 architecture:

Type	Size (bits)	Representation
int	32	Two's complement
long	64	Two's complement
float	32	IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point
double	64	IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point
char	8	ASCII
bool	1	1 = true, 0 = false
It is important to note that the machine-level representation of built-in types can vary from compiler to compiler and from architecture to architecture.
