In the previous cases we have seen how to add all numbers from;

1 till a fixed number.
1 till a fixed number given by the user. 
//All of which we have seen from whixh and for loop.

eg;
if the user enters:1 2 3 4 5
Output should be:Sum = 15

-When we use istream as test condition,the effect is to test the state of the stream.
-If the stream is valid,then the test succeeds.
-The istream becomes invalid when we hit a end-of-file or encounter an invalid input.//(ctrl + z) to get out of the loop.

#include <iostream>

int main() {

  int sum = 0,value = 0;

while(std::cin >> value) {
sum+=value;

  }

  std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
  }
