The const qualifier in C++ is used to declare a variable as constant. This means that the value of the variable cannot be changed once it has been initialized.

To declare a constant variable, you simply add the const keyword before the type of the variable. For example, the following code declares a constant integer variable:

const int x = 10;

Once the variable x has been initialized, its value cannot be changed. For example, the following code will not compile:

x = 20; // error: cannot assign to variable 'x' with const-qualified type 'const int'

The const qualifier can be used to declare any type of variable, including integers, floats, characters, strings, and objects. It can also be used to declare pointers and references.

There are several reasons why you might want to declare a variable as constant:

To prevent the value of the variable from being changed accidentally.
To improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
To make your code more efficient.
