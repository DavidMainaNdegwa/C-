Signed and unsigned types in C++ are two different ways of representing integer values. 
Signed types can represent both positive and negative values, while unsigned types can only represent positive values.

The difference between signed and unsigned types is how the most significant bit (MSB) is used.
In signed types, the MSB is used to represent the sign of the number. If the MSB is 1, the number is negative. 
If the MSB is 0, the number is positive.

In unsigned types, the MSB is used to represent the magnitude of the number. 
This means that unsigned types can store larger numbers than signed types.

The following table shows the range of values that can be represented by the different signed and unsigned integer types in C++:

Type	Range
signed char	-128 to 127
unsigned char	0 to 255
signed short	-32768 to 32767
unsigned short	0 to 65535
signed int	-2147483648 to 2147483647
unsigned int	0 to 4294967295
signed long	-2147483648 to 2147483647
unsigned long	0 to 4294967295
