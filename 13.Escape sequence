An escape sequence in C++ is a special sequence of characters that is used to represent a non-printable character or a special character.
Escape sequences are prefixed with a backslash (\) character.

| Escape sequence | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| \ | Backslash |
| ' | Single quote |
| " | Double quote |
| ? | Question mark |
| \a | Alert (bell) |
| \b | Backspace |
| \f | Form feed |
| \n | Newline |
| \r | Carriage return |
| \t | Tab |
| \v | Vertical tab |

Escape sequences can be used in a variety of ways in C++ code. For example, they can be used to:

Represent non-printable characters, such as a newline character or a tab character.
Represent special characters, such as a single quote or a double quote.
Create multi-line strings.
Format output.
