-A "for loop" is a control structure in programming that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specified number of times or
based on a specific condition.It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update, 
and it's commonly used for tasks that involve iteration or looping.

-A for each loop, also known as a range-based for loop, is a type of loop that is used to iterate over the elements of a range. 
Ranges can be arrays, vectors, strings, or any other iterable data structure.

-For each loops are very concise and easy to read, and they can be used to simplify many common programming tasks. 
-For example, the following code shows how to use a for each loop to print all of the elements of an array:
int main() {
  int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  for (int number : numbers) {
    cout << number << " ";
  }

  cout << number << endl;

  return 0;
}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5

# include <iostream>

int main() {

int sum = 0;
for(int i = 1; i<=10 ;i++) {
sum += i;//same as sum = sum + 1;

}
std::cout << "The sum of 1 to 10 is " << sum << std::endl;
return 0;
}

OUTPUT
The sum of 1 to 10 is 55

2.TAKING INPUT FROM USER
# include <iostream>

int main() {

int sum = 0,val;

std::cout << "Enter a number between 1 and 10: ";
std::cin >> val;

for(int i = 1; i<=val ;i++) {
sum += i;//same as sum = sum + 1;

}
std::cout << "The sum of 1 to "<< val << " is " << sum << std::endl;
return 0;
}

OUTPUT
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 9
The sum of 1 to 9 is 45
