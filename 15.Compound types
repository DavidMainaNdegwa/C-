Compound types in C++ are types that are constructed from other types. There are several different types of compound types in C++, including:

Arrays: Arrays are a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are declared using the following syntax:
int x = 10;

Pointers: Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. Pointers are declared using the following syntax:
int* x;

References: References are aliases for other variables. References are declared using the following syntax:
int y = 20;
int &x = y;

Structs: Structs are user-defined types that can contain a collection of members of different types. Structs are declared using the following syntax:
struct values {
int x;
float y;
}

Classes: Classes are similar to structs, but they can also contain functions and other features. Classes are declared using the following syntax:
class class_name {
  type member1;
  type member2;
  ...
  function1();
  function2();
  ...
};
