Literals in C++ are fixed values that cannot be modified. T
hey can be used directly in the code without having to be assigned to a variable. There are five types of literals in C++:

Integer literals: Integer literals can be decimal, octal, or hexadecimal. 

Decimal literals are written as a sequence of digits, with no prefix. 

Octal literals are prefixed with 0. Hexadecimal literals are prefixed with 0x or 0X.

Floating-point literals: Floating-point literals can be represented in decimal or exponential form.

Decimal floating-point literals must include a decimal point. 

Exponential floating-point literals must include an exponent, which is prefixed with e or E.

Character literals: Character literals are enclosed in single quotation marks.

For example, the character literal 'a' represents the ASCII character 'a'.

String literals: String literals are enclosed in double quotation marks.
For example, the string literal "Hello, world!" represents the string "Hello, world!".

Boolean literals: Boolean literals are either true or false.

Here are some examples of literals in C++:

C++
// Integer literals
int x = 10;
int y = 0123; // octal literal
int z = 0xFF; // hexadecimal literal

// Floating-point literals
float a = 3.14f;
double b = 6.28;

// Character literals
char c = 'a';

// String literals
string s = "Hello, world!";

// Boolean literals
bool d = true;
bool e = false;

Literals are a fundamental part of C++ programming. 
They allow programmers to express fixed values in their code without having to use variables.
