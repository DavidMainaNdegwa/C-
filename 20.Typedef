Typedef in C++ is a keyword that allows you to create a new name for an existing type. 
This can be useful for making your code more readable and maintainable, or for creating more complex types.

To declare a typedef, you use the following syntax:

C++
typedef <type-name> <new-type-name>;

Eg;the following code declares a typedef for a type called MyInteger, which is simply another name for the type int:
typedef int MyInteger;
