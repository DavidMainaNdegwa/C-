The auto type specifier in C++11 allows the compiler to deduce the type of a variable from its initializer expression. 
This can be useful for making your code more concise and readable, and for avoiding errors.

To use the auto type specifier, simply declare a variable with the auto keyword and initialize it with an expression. 
The compiler will then deduce the type of the variable from the type of the expression.

For example, the following code declares a variable x using the auto type specifier and initializes it with the value 10:

C++
auto x = 10;

To use the auto type specifier, simply declare a variable with the auto keyword and initialize it with an expression.

For example, the following code declares a variable x using the auto type specifier and initializes it with the value 10:

C++
auto x = 10;

The compiler will deduce the type of x to be int, since the value 10 is an integer.

You can also use the auto type specifier to declare variables of more complex types, such as pointers and references. 
For example, the following code declares a variable p using the auto type specifier and initializes it with a pointer to the variable x:

auto p = &x;

The compiler will deduce the type of p to be int*, since the variable x is an int and &x is a pointer to an int.
