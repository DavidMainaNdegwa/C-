A nested scope in C++ is a scope that is contained within another scope. 
Scopes are used to organize code and to control the visibility of variables.

A scope begins with an opening curly brace ({) and ends with a closing curly brace (}). 
Any variables that are declared within a scope are only visible to the code within that scope and any nested scopes.

Here are some examples of how nested scopes can be used:

To group related code together. For example, you might use nested scopes to group all of the code for a particular function or class.
To hide implementation details. For example, you might use a nested scope to hide the implementation details of a function or class.
To limit the visibility of variables. For example, you might use a nested scope to limit the visibility of a variable 
to a particular function or class.
Nested scopes are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the readability, maintainability, and security of C++ code.
