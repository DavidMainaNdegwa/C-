Top-level const and low-level const are two different types of const qualifiers that can be used in C++ to indicate whether a pointer or reference is constant.

Top-level const qualifiers apply to the pointer or reference itself, meaning that the pointer or reference itself cannot be reassigned.
Low-level const qualifiers apply to the object that the pointer or reference points to, meaning that the object cannot be modified through the pointer or reference.

It is important to note that top-level const and low-level const are not mutually exclusive. 
A pointer or reference can be both top-level const and low-level const, or it can be either top-level const or low-level const, or it can be neither.

Here are some examples of top-level const and low-level const:

C++
// Top-level const
int* const p1 = new int(10); // pointer to a constant int
const int* p2 = new int(20); // pointer to a constant int

// Low-level const
int* p3 = new int(30);
const int& r = *p3; // reference to a constant int

// Both top-level and low-level const
const int* const p4 = new int(40); // constant pointer to a constant int

In the first example, p1 is a top-level const pointer to a constant int. 
This means that the pointer itself cannot be reassigned, and the int that it points to cannot be modified through the pointer.

In the second example, p2 is a pointer to a constant int. 
This means that the int that it points to cannot be modified through the pointer. However, the pointer itself can be reassigned.

In the third example, r is a reference to a constant int. This means that the int that it refers to cannot be modified through the reference. H
owever, the reference itself can be reassigned to another constant int.

In the fourth example, p4 is a top-level const pointer to a constant int. 
This means that the pointer itself cannot be reassigned, and the int that it points to cannot be modified through the pointer.

Top-level const and low-level const can be used to improve the quality of your C++ code. 
They can help to prevent errors and make your code more readable and maintainable.

Here are some tips for using top-level const and low-level const safely in C++:

Only declare pointers and references as constant if you are sure that their values will not need to be changed.
Be careful when passing pointers and references to functions. If the function modifies the object that the pointer or reference points to, you may get unexpected results.
Be careful when using constant pointers and references. You cannot modify the value of the object that a constant pointer or reference points to, but you can modify the object itself.
