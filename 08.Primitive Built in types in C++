Types are fundamental to any program.
They tell us what our data mean and what operations we can perform on those data.

C++ has extensive support for types:
-Primitive types(characters,integers,floating-point numbers,etc)-
Defined by the language itself. 
*Arthimetic Type:
Integral types-Characters,integers,boolean values etc &
Floating point types - Float,double etc.
-User-defined types - Provides mechanisms that let us define our own data types.

The Size of Arithmetic Types

In C++, the size of arithmetic types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, 
can vary depending on the implementation and the target platform. The `sizeof` 
operator can be used to determine the size of a type in bytes.

Here are some common sizes for arithmetic types on most platforms:

- `char`: 1 byte
wchar_t : wide character : 2 or 4 bytes
char16_t : Unicode character : 2bytes 
char32_t : Unicode character : 4 bytes
- `short`: 2 bytes
- `int`: 4 bytes
- `long`: 4 bytes
- `long long`: 8 bytes
- `float`: 4 bytes
- `double`: 8 bytes
- `long double`: 16 bytes

Keep in mind that these sizes are not guaranteed and may vary on different systems. 
It's always a good practice to use the `sizeof` operator to obtain the size of a specific type on a given platform.

floats are represented in one word(32bits)
doubles in two words (64bits)
long doubles in either three or four words (96 or 128 bits)
