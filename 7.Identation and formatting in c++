C++ programs are largely free format
-Where we put braces,identation,comments and newlines usually 
has no effect on what our programs mean.
Eg:
The curly braces { that denotes the beginning of the body of main could be on:
The same line as main
At the beginning line as main
Placed anywhere else we'd like
Readability and comprehension
For clean code - Space as mucha as possible.
For consistency - Once youve chosen a style,use it constitently.
